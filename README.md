## From Reviews to Insights: Advanced Topic Modeling in Gaming
### Overview
This study analyzes Steam video game reviews to identify players’ needs and preferences using three topic modeling methods: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Top2Vec, and BERTopic. The objective is to determine which method provides the most accurate and insightful analysis of these reviews. The findings indicate that BERTopic outperforms the other models in terms of coherence, relevance, interpretability, and topic diversity, offering actionable insights for game developers. Additionally, augmenting the results with OpenAI’s GPT-4o proves to be useful in enhancing the interpretability of the identified topics. The study concludes by recommending BERTopic for analyzing video game reviews and suggests further research to enhance topic modeling evaluation metrics.
